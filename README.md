# Not So Simple Pipes
A [Simple BC Pipes](https://github.com/AlexIIL/SimplePipes) addon that adds some extra pipes.

## Pipes
### Lava Item Pipe
This pipe will delete all items that flow into it.

### Void Fluid Pipe
This pipe will delete all fluids that flow into it.

## BuildCraft Compatibility
Once BuildCraft is released, a port of this mod with duplicate functionality removed will be released as a BC addon.
